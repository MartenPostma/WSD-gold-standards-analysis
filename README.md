# WSD gold standards analysis

This module provides an [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
to analyze existing manually annotated gold standards 
(annotated with wordnet sense keys, which is why sem2010-aw is not in here)
used to evaluate Word Sense Disambiguation.

This module was written in Python 3.4.
Everything should work by installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
Alternatively, the external modules should be installed by running:
